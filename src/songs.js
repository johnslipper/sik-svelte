      "Sha la la la la la la, hmm, uh huh,\n\nI was down at the New Amsterdam,\n\nStaring at this yellow-haired girl,\n\nMr. Jones strikes up a conversation,\n\nWith a black-haired flamenco dancer,\n\nYou know she dances while his father plays guitar,\n\nSo she's suddenly beautiful,\n\nAnd we all want something beautiful,\n\nMan I wish I was beautiful.\nSo come dance this silence down through the mornin'\n\nSha la la la la la la la yeah, uh huh yeah,\n\nCurl up, Maria! Show me some of that Spanish dancin'\n\nAnd pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones.\n\nBelieve in me, help me believe in anything,\n\n'Cause I, I wanna be someone who believes, yeah.\nMr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales,\n\nAnd we stare at the beautiful women,\n\n‘She's looking at you. Ah, no, no, she's looking at me.‘\n\nSmiling in the bright lights, coming through in stereo,\n\nWhen everybody loves you, you can never be lonely.\nWell, I'm gonna paint my picture,\n\nPaint myself in blue and red and black and gray,\n\nAll of the beautiful colors are very very meaningful,\n\nYeah, well you know gray is my favorite color,\n\nI felt so symbolic yesterday, if I knew Picasso,\n\nI would buy myself a gray guitar and play.\nMr. Jones and me look into the future,\n\nYeah, we stare at the beautiful women,\n\n‘She's looking at you. I don't think so. She's looking at me.‘\n\nStanding in the spotlight, I bought myself a gray guitar,\n\nWhen everybody loves me, I will never be lonely,\n\nI will never be lonely, son, I'm never gonna be lonely.\nI wanna be a lion, \n\nE-Everybody wants to pass as cats,\n\nWe all wanna be big big stars,\n\nYeah but we've got different reasons for that,\n\nBelieve in me 'cause I don't believe in anything,\n\nAnd I, I wanna be someone to believe,\n\nTo believe, to believe, yeah.\nMr. Jones and me stumbling through the barrio,\n\nYeah we stare at the beautiful women,\n\n‘She's perfect for you, Man, there's got to be somebody for me.‘\n\nI wanna be Bob Dylan,\n\nMr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky,\n\nWhen everybody loves you, oh, son,\n\nThat's just' bout as funky as you can be.\nMr. Jones and me staring at the video,\n\nWhen I look at the television,\n\nI wanna see me staring right back at me,\n\nWe all wanna be big stars,\n\nBut we don't know why and we don't know how,\n\nBut when everybody loves me,\n\nI wanna be just' bout as happy as I could be,\n\nMr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars.\n",

      "Well, I heard there was a secret chord\n\nThat David played, and it pleased the Lord\n\nBut you don't really care for music, do ya?\nWell, it goes like this: the fourth, the fifth,\n\nThe minor fall and the major lift,\n\nThe baffled king composing Hallelujah\nHallelujah, Hallelujah,\n\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nWell, your faith was strong, but you needed proof,\n\nYou saw her bathing on the roof\n\nHer beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya\nAnd she tied you to her kitchen chair,\n\nAnd she broke your throne and she cut your hair,\n\nAnd from your lips she drew the Hallelujah\nHallelujah, Hallelujah,\n\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nWell, baby, I've been here before,\n\nI've seen this room and I've walked this floor\n\nYou know, I used to live alone before I knew ya\nAnd I've seen your flag on the marble arch\n\nAnd love is not a victory march,\n\nIt's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah\nHallelujah, Hallelujah,\n\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nWell, there was a time when you let me know\n\nWhat's really going on below,\n\nBut now you never show that to me, do ya?\nBut remember when I moved in you,\n\nAnd the holy dove was moving too\n\nAnd every breath we drew was Hallelujah\nHallelujah, Hallelujah,\n\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nWell, maybe there is a God above\n\nBut all I've ever learned from love,\n\nWas how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya\nAnd it's not a cry that you hear at night\n\nIt's not somebody who's seen the light,\n\nIt's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah\nHallelujah, Hallelujah,\n\nHallelujah, Hallelujah,\n\nHallelujah, Hallelujah,\n\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nHallelujah, Hallelujah,\n\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nHallelujah\n",

      "Off in the distance something catches your eye\n\nThey bait and switch your laughter for your cry\n\nYou got burned the last time around\n\nThey had you looking at the sky while they were digging in the ground\n\nYou seem to lose your focus way up close\n\nYou’re can’t see the things that you need the most\n\nAnd they’ve blown your intuition apart\n\nLeft you fumbling for a light somewhere in the dark \n\nOh, you’ve got to hold\n\nWhat your heart knows\n\nAnd don’t let go\n\nTalking in circles with senators\n\nOr they don’t recall whichever you prefer\n\nThey’re smiling nervously and biding time\n\nSo you keep your cards close and I’ll hide mine \n\nWe repeat ourselves but we don’t know what to do\n\nWe read our history books and see nothing new\n\nBut they can focus your gaze somewhere else\n\nWhile they’re digging in the ground halfway to hell\n\nOh, you’ve got to hold\n\nWhat your heart knows\n\nAnd don’t let go\n\nUntil someone here turns the light on\n\nSomeone here turns the light on \n\nAll the eyes are searching around looking at us\n\nAnd they’re wondering in which god that we trust\n\nAnd it’s anything, everything that we lust\n\nWe invented it all and then went bust \n\nSomeone will come along with something new\n\nThey’ll feed you a line and they’ll swear it’s true\n\nBut you’ve still got a little good left in your heart\n\nYou want to trust again don’t know where to start\n\n Oh, you’ve got to hold\n\nWhat your heart knows\n\nAnd don’t let go\n\nUntil someone here turns the light on\n\nSomeone here turns the light on\n",

    lyrics:
      "Lost in the city and it’s hard to believe \n\nThat a stranger won’t look me in the eye \n\nI must have stumbled across a lonely land \n\nI’ve been left out here to die \n\nEveryone knows that it’s nothing new \n\nIt’s caught up in the air we breath \n\nI tried to stay but it wouldn’t do \n\nAnd you know it’s hard to leave \n\nYou let those plans \n\nSlip right through your hands \n\nLove gets lost again \n\nYou let those plans \n\nSlip right through your hands \n\nLove gets lost again \n\nThe moment happened just like that \n\nAnd it needed no help, no plan \n\nSo let us speak free between us now \n\nIn a language we both understand \n\nThe feeling fades before too long \n\nYou try to bottle it up inside \n\nBut if you let yourself get dragged on down \n\nYou’ll never stand up in time \n\nYou let those plans \n\nSlip right through your hands \n\nLove gets lost again \n\nYou let those plans \n\nSlip right through your hands \n\nLove gets lost again \n\nIt’s barely enough, these things we have \n\nThat we’re left to fight for air \n\nAnd a piece of love gets rationed out \n\nIn the distance, somewhere out there \n\nSo if you see her off in a corner somewhere \n\nJust looking towards the ground \n\nIt’s not that I didn’t try \n\nShe just wasn’t looking to be found \n\nIf you’re quiet then you’re dangerous \n\nSo don’t you whisper those strange lies \n\nLove casts doubt and it’s hard to trust \n\nWhen you look in someone else’s eyes \n\nWhen you look in someone else’s eyes \n\nYou let those plans \n\nSlip right through your hands \n\nLove gets lost again \n\nYou let those plans \n\nSlip right through your hands \n\nLove gets lost again \n\nAgain \n\nAgain \n\nAgain\n",

Pass it around.\nOne night thunder cracked.\n\nMercy backed outside my windowsill.\n\nDreamed I was flying\n\nHigh above the trees, over the hills.\n\nLooked down into the house of Mary.\n\nTerrible thoughts, newspaper covered walls.\n\nAnd Mary rising up above it all.\n\nOh... Oh... Oh...\nNext morning on the way into town\n\nSaw some skid marks and followed them around.\n\nOver the curve,\n\nThrough the fields,\n\nInto the house of Mary.\nThat what you fear the most could meet you halfway.

      "Once divided, nothing left to subtract\n\nSome words when spoken can't be taken back\n\nWalks on his own with thoughts he can't help thinking\n\nFuture's above, but in the past, he's slow and sinking\n\nCaught a bolt 'a lightning, cursed the day he let it go\nNothingman\n\nNothingman\n\nIsn't it something?\n\nNothingman\nShe once believed in every story he had to tell\n\nOne day she stiffened, took the other side\n\nEmpty stares from each corner of a shared prison cell\n\nOne just escapes, one's left inside the well\n\nAnd he who forgets will be destined to remember\nNothingman\n\nNothingman\n\nIsn't it something?\n\nNothingman\nOh, she don't want him\n\nOh, she won't feed him after he's flown away\n\nOh, into the sun, ah, into the sun\nBurn, burn\n\nNothingman\n\nNothingman\n\nIsn't it something?\n\nNothingman\n\nNothingman\n\nNothingman\n\nCould've been something\n\nNothingman\n\nOh... oh... oh...\n",

      "I don't practice Santeria, I ain't got no crystal ball \n\nOh I had a million dollars but I'd, I'd spent it all\n\nIf I could find that Heina, and that Sancho that she's found \n\nWell I'd pop a cap in Sancho, and I'd slap her down\nWhat I really wanna know, ah, baby, mmm\n\nWhat I really wanna say, I can't define \n\nWell, it's love, that I need, oh!\nMy soul will have to\n\nWait till I get back, find a Heina of my own \n\nDaddy's gonna love one and all\n\nI feel the break, feel the break, feel the break \n\nAnd I gotta live it up, oh yeah, huh, well I swear that I\nWhat I really wanna know, my baby, mmm-hmm\n\nWhat I really wanna say, I can't define \n\nBack, love, make it go\n\nMy soul will have to\nOoh, what I really wanna say, my baby \n\nWhat I really wanna say, is I've got mine\n\nAnd I'll make it, yes I'm coming up\n\nTell Sanchito, that if he knows what is good for him, he best go run and hide\n\nDaddy's got a new forty-five\n\nAnd I won't think twice to stick that barrel straight down Sancho's throat \n\nBelieve me when I say that I got something for his punk ass\nWhat I really wanna know, my baby \n\nOoh, what I really wanna say is there's just one\n\nWay back, and I'll make it, yeah\n\nMy soul will have to wait\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n",
